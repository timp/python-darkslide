  Contributed by Eric Moyer in `#19 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/pull/19>`_.

Darkslide v5.1.0 (2020-01-13)
=============================

* Refactored user css and js path processing code.
* Relativized user css and js paths to the configuration directory (CWD if there's no configuration file).

Darkslide v5.0.2 (2019-12-07)
=============================

* Fixed a small bug in the image embedding feature (image detection in CSS file
  could fail).

Darkslide v5.0.1 (2019-10-01)
=============================

* Fixed media for user css to be always be ``all``. Previously it was ``screen, projection`` if embedded.

Darkslide v5.0.0 (2019-09-29)
=============================

* Removed PDF export support. You should just use the PDF export from
  Google Chrome (it works way better than the alternatives).
* Fixed transitions in presenter mode.
* Added support for Up/Down arrow navigation.
  Contributed by Heiko Schlittermann in `#13 <https://github.com/ionelmc/python-darkslide/pull/13>`_.

Darkslide v4.0.1 (2017-10-19)
=============================

* Fixed print css a bit.
* Fixed missing scrolling to current when changing slides while in overview mode.

Darkslide v4.0.0 (2017-10-17)
=============================

* Dropped MathJax support. Something less to maintain (also, didn't work as expected with ``--embed``). User that need this
  should just use the ``user_js`` option. Or a custom theme.
* Changed themes to use a space-adjusted Alegreya Sans as a fallback.

Darkslide v3.2.0 (2017-10-17)
=============================

* Changed themes to use Rosario as a fallback. For better or worse it's smaller and has same width as Candara.


Darkslide v3.1.0 (2017-10-17)
=============================

* Changed themes to embed a Candara fallback webfont (Alegreya Sans). It's slightly narrower but looks more similar than the other
  alternatives better matching Candara's width (Acme, Galdeano). It even has ligatures.

Darkslide v3.0.1 (2017-10-15)
=============================

* Fixed slightly broken slide class changing.
* Made expose mode scroll to current slide.
* Running presenter mode with no target won't break
  anymore if target window is gone.
* Fixed display of presenter notes.

Darkslide v3.0.0 (2017-10-05)
=============================

* Removed "expanded mode". It was too buggy and doesn't really have a purpose.
* Changed "show context" to be "show next slide" (so two slides at a time). This is way more useful than showing little
  bits of next and prev slides.
* Fixed ``--direct`` on Python 3.
* Fixed glitches when TOC/Help are open.
* Made possible to switch slides when TOC/Help/Overview are open.

Darkslide v2.3.3 (2016-05-15)
=============================

* Fixed height of QR svg elements.

Darkslide v2.3.2 (2016-04-12)
=============================

Darkslide v2.3.1 (2016-02-08)
=============================

* MathJax is loaded on HTTPS.

Darkslide v2.3.0 (2016-02-07)
=============================

* The Darkslide version is shown in the help sidebar.

Darkslide v2.2.1 (2015-10-06)
=============================

* Fixed config file parsing for math_output.

Darkslide v2.2.0 (2015-10-06)
=============================

* Now macro failures abort rendering. Previously they would just log a message that you'd probably woulnd't notice.
* Fixed broken handling where you have css/js in the cfg file.
* Allowed setting the math_output option in the cfg file.
* Fixed encoding issues in the QR macro.
* Added back the old theme with completely black background (as "void").
* Tweak the faux underlines to look better.

Darkslide v2.1.0 (2015-10-05)
=============================

* Added demo links.
* Fixed options handling. Options from command line now will actually work if a cfg file is used.
* Corrected relative paths handling:

  - paths in sources are now relative to the cfg file (previously they were relative to whatever was cwd).
  - relative option now correctly works when destination file is not in cwd.
* Fixed layout of slides with many headering (no more paddings for headings, all root elements are spread out evenly
  anyway).
* Fixed bad styling of ToC (and probably other things in the sidebar).
* Fixed ToC links (contributed by Cyrille Pontvieux).

Darkslide v2.0.4 (2015-09-09)
=============================

* Improved handling for filenames that have non-ascii characters in them.

Darkslide v2.0.3 (2015-09-08)
=============================

Darkslide v2.0.2 (2015-07-20)
=============================

- Added color classes in the abyss theme.
- Fixed link underlines in the presenter notes.

Darkslide v2.0.1 (2015-07-19)
=============================

* Don't use Monaco in the ``base.css`` - it's way bigger than Consolas and the other fonts. And Consolas is nice enough.

Darkslide v2.0.0 (2015-07-17)
=============================

- Fix display of RST image target links.
- Add cmd line option to print version.
- Rewrote the default theme (solarized colors)
- Overhauled the abyss theme, improved the coloring.
- Removed all the other themes (they are ugly and broken anyway) (**backwards incompatible**).
- Fixes for print css.

  makes reusing styles acros themes and kinds of display (print/screen) more easy.
- Expanded mode is now activated by default.
- Changed macros to use compiled regexes.
- Added a footnote macro.
- Changed QR macro to use ``qrcode`` library. Now it's rendered to SVG. The size is removed (**backwards incompatible**).

=============================

- Fix the blank page issue when generating pdfs (via Chrome's pdf printer).

=============================

- Couple minor improvements to Abyss theme.

Darkslide v1.2.0 (2015-05-19)
=============================

  alt-tab etc); now it's cleared on visibility changes and focus loss.
- Changed expanded mode to automatically hide the context.
- Fixed window resize flickering (for every resize event the expaded flag was toggled).
- Disabled context hiding in presenter view.
- Other small styling improvements.
- Added "abyss" theme.
